# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Detailed Study Guide - Part 1

## 1. Security Architecture (21% of exam)

### 1.1 Network Security Architecture

#### Network Segmentation Deep Dive

**Concept Explanation:**
Network segmentation divides a network into smaller, isolated segments to improve security by containing breaches and controlling access. Think of it like a ship with watertight compartments – if one section is compromised, the others remain secure.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**

   - Purpose: Hosts public-facing services while protecting internal network
   - Components:
     ```
     External Firewall: Filters internet traffic
     DMZ Servers: Web, email, DNS
     Internal Firewall: Protects internal network
     ```
   - Example Configuration:
     ```
     External Zone: 203.0.113.0/24 (Public IPs)
     DMZ: 172.16.1.0/24
     Internal: 192.168.0.0/16
     ```

2. **VLAN Segmentation**
   - Department-based separation:
     ```
     VLAN 10: Finance (High Security)
     VLAN 20: Marketing (Medium Security)
     VLAN 30: Guest Network (Low Security)
     ```
   - Security measures per VLAN:

     ```
     Finance VLAN:
     - 802.1X authentication
     - IPS monitoring
     - Encrypted traffic only

     Marketing VLAN:
     - Standard authentication
     - Basic IDS monitoring
     - Mixed traffic allowed
     ```

#### Zero Trust Architecture

**Core Principles:**

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**

   - Every access request is validated regardless of source
   - No automatic trust based on network location

2. **Least Privilege Access**

   ```
   Example Access Matrix:
   Marketing Manager:
   - Can access: Marketing files, Campaign tools
   - Cannot access: Financial records, HR systems
   - Time restriction: 8 AM - 6 PM
   - Location: Office IP range only
   ```

3. **Micro-segmentation**
   ```
   Application-level segmentation:
   Web Server → Application Server → Database
   Each hop requires:
   - Identity verification
   - Policy check
   - Encrypted communication
   - Activity logging
   ```
